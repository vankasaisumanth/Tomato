**For developing a chat bot**
• Identify the opportunities for an AI-based chatbot
• Understanding what are the goals of building a chatbot
• Designing a chatbot conversation
• Building a chatbot using frameworks or development (non-coding) platforms

__Before building a chatbot, first you should understand what are the opportunities for an AI-based chatbot:__
let us consider how best to apply this new Bot technologies, they need a way to think about what types of work can be automated or augmented
by Artificial Intelligence solutions.

For a particular type of work activity, Artificial Intelligence solutions can be considered based on two criteria
1. Work Complexity
2. Data Complexity

This dual analysis of work complexity and data complexity results in four primary types of activity models:
•Efficiency
•Expert 
•Effectiveness 
•Innovation

**Understanding what are the goals of building a chatbot**
•Understanding why do we need to built the chatbot. 
•what are the basic features and functionalities we want to add to it.
•what is the best laguage to code the chatbot and 
•what is the best framework to choose
•what are the pre-requisites need to di it? (do we need to know machine learning, deep learning?)


__Designing a chatbot conversation:__
Chatbot interactions are segmented into structured and unstructured interactions.As the name suggests, the structured type is more 
about the logical flow of information including menus, choices and forms into account. The unstructured conversation flow includes 
freestyle plain text. Such as conversations with family, colleagues, friends and other acquaintances fall into this segment. 
Developing scripts for these messages will follow suit. While developing the script for messages, it is important to keep the 
conversation topics close to the purpose served by the chatbot. For the designer, interpreting user’s answers is important to 
develop scripts for a conversational user interface. The designer also turns his attention to close-ended conversations that are 
easy to handle and open-ended conversations that allow customers to communicate naturally.
